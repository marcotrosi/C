# C

## Preface

Hello and welcome,

this repository contains a growing list of chapters that try to explain the C programming language. If you know another
language or if you already started with C but you didn't get it fully, then this might be the right place for you. I'm
trying to explain it maybe a bit different then you might know from C books, but this is the whole point. A different
wording/perspective and some handcrafted images combined with the knowledge you already have might help you to
understand more and close some gaps. More chapters will follow. Any feedback is appreciated. The examples might often be
from a unixoid perspective, just that you know.

Have fun
